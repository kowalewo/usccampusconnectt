                <h3>Need a venue for your event? </h3>
                    <p>USC offers a variety of spaces that students can reserve for hosting events! Just in and around Russell House alone, students can reserve rooms such as a large ballroom, conference rooms, game rooms, a theater, a chapel, and even outdoor spaces! To learn more about reservations in Russell House, click <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/russell_house/reserve-space/rooms/index.php">Here!</a></p>

                <h3>Not sure how to promote your event? </h3>
                <p>One way to promote your event is to click <a href="websiteeventcalendar.html">Here</a> and fill out the form so 
                    your event can be on the event calendar here! </p>
                <p>You can also make a flyer on Canva and post about your event on your socials! The South Carolina Snapchat story is 
                    a great place to start as it will already allow several thousand people to learn about your event. Also, posting it 
                    to your insta story or making a TikTok video about you preparing the event will get people excited! If you want to 
                    throw some physical copies out into the world, printing flyers and hanging them in Russell House, around your 
                    apartment complex, and in buildings where you have classes are a great idea too!</p>

                <h3>Want to find the right club for you?</h3>
                <p>There are so many organizations, social groups, and events going on at USC so finding the right place to start 
                    can be overwhelming. First, consider your hobbies, career goals, and social setting size preferences. Think about 
                    whether you want to join an academic organization, a sports club, or just a socializing group! It can be helpful to 
                    attend meet and greets and talk with current members to get a vibe of the group! You can visit the 
                    <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/leadership_and_service_center/student_organizations/">UofSC 
                        Leadership and Service Center</a> as well to learn about different organizations and finding the perfect 
                        community for you!</p>
